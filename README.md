### Behavioral Driven Development Steps:
| Behavior | Input | Output |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| Store a file for user | upload (file).(extension) | website stores file |
| User can ask for the file back | Request file from server | server sends file back |
| Create unique users for individual file containers | User "A" uploads file | File is stored and attributed to user "A" |
| User "A" can delete their own "capsule" | Clicks delete | All data for that specific user is deleted |
| Allow anyone to register an account | User (n) creates account and upload file(s) | All files are stored under user (n)'s name |
